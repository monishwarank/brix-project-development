# Fitness Software

**Project Description**  
An intermediate-level software designed to help users perform fitness exercises. It includes an authentication system with options for advanced recognition methods and tracks exercise progress through camera-based monitoring.

**Requirements**

- **Authentication System**: Can use advanced methods like eye, face, or voice recognition for extra points, or standard authentication (user ID and password).
- **Exercise Monitoring**:
  - Displays 5 exercises, with animations guiding the user.
  - Each exercise transitions to a 10-second break before moving to the next.
- **Completion Screen**: A congratulatory message appears after all exercises are completed.
- **Data Management**: Store exercise data in Firebase or export it to an Excel sheet.
